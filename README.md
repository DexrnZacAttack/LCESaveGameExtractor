# LCE Savegame extractor

### MAY NOT WORK ACROSS ALL VERSIONS AND EDITIONS

## Tested on:
- Xbox 360 Edition (TU75)
- Playstation 3 Edition (1.0.0)
- Wii U Edition (latest)
- PS4 Edition (latest)
- [Nintendo Switch Edition](/docs/NSWE.md)
<br>
<br>

### This was made really quickly because someone was talking about connecting to LCE servers in Java, I had mentioned that there needs to be a way to even read the world in JE, and then had an idea to make this.
