# LCE Savegame extractor

### MAY NOT WORK ACROSS ALL VERSIONS AND EDITIONS

## Tested on:
- XB360 Edition (New Format)
- PS3 Edition (equiv to JE 1.0)

<br>

### This was made really quickly because someone was talking about connecting to LCE servers in Java, I had mentioned that there needs to be a way to even read the world in JE, and then had an idea to make this.
