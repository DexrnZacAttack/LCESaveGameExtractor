### MAY NOT WORK ACROSS ALL VERSIONS AND EDITIONS

## Tested on:
- XB360 Edition (TU75)
- PS3 Edition (1.0.0)
- Wii U Edition (latest)
- Switch

  note: Switch uses Little endianness, and also uses a modification of Infdev 624's entities.dat...![Dexrn_notepad++_lw1F8wAZbF_01-31-2024_02_47_40_356_AM](https://github.com/DexrnZacAttack/LCESaveGameExtractor/assets/60078656/9564ef46-aeaa-4e5b-b671-ccd04f9479fd)
