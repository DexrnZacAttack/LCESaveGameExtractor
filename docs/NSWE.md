# Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition

### This edition uses Little Endian instead of Big Endian which PS3, Wii U, and Xbox 360 edition use.
### It seems that entities are stored seperate, inside entities.dat which looks to be a modified version of Infdev 627's entities.dat.

### Chunks are stored outside of the main gamedata, instead in these GAMEDATA_ files.
